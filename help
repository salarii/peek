Application Geared Toward Linux Users
-------------------------------------

This application is primarily designed for Linux users. Functionality on other operating systems is not guaranteed. Currently, the Peek app operates in two modes:

1. Terminal Mode: Provides basic terminal capabilities, allowing users to navigate the system with commands like 'ls', 'cd', etc., to locate a log file of interest. This is the default mode upon running the Peek application.

2. File Analyzing Mode: Enables users to perform various search operations on a log file loaded into memory. It includes several custom commands to aid in this process.

Switching Between Modes
-----------------------

- In Terminal Mode, use the command: 'fm@system_path'. Here, 'system_path' is the path to the log file you wish to analyze.
- In File Analyze Mode, use the command: 'sm@'.

Commands in System Mode
-----------------------

Motivation: Managing large log files can be overwhelming due to the excessive, often irrelevant information. This can lead to distractions and difficulties in focusing on key details. The app includes capabilities to:

- Display only lines containing a specific phrase.
- Hide (blacklist) lines containing certain phrases.
- Color specific phrases, leaving the rest of the text unchanged.
- Perform the above with regex patterns instead of literal phrases.
- View specific log sections, cut text line-to-line, or cut text between phrases/regex patterns.

File Analyzing Mode Commands
----------------------------

- Press Enter: Displays the entire log unaltered.
- Enter Phrases: Typing 'phrase1 phrase2 phrase3' and pressing enter shows only lines with these phrases (no spaces allowed in phrases).
- Blacklist Phrases: Typing 'b@phrase1 b@phrase2 b@phrase3' and pressing enter hides lines with these phrases.
- Color Phrases: Typing 'c@phrase1 c@phrase2 c@phrase3' and pressing enter colors these phrases in all lines.
- Regex Patterns: Typing 'r@pattern1 rc@pattern2 rb@pattern3' and pressing enter uses regex patterns. Lists lines with 'pattern1', excluding those with 'pattern3', and colors 'pattern2' if present. Regex processing is very slow.
- Numbered Lines: Typing 'nl@' with other commands and pressing enter numbers each line in the result.
- And mode: 'and@( pattern1 pattern b@pattern3  )' in this mode of operation, only lines of text will be presented where the provided phrases and patterns are present.
- Text Between two Phrases/Patterns: Typing '->@phrase ->r@pattern' and pressing enter shows text between lines containing the specified phrase or regex pattern.
- Specific Line Ranges: Typing 's->100@', '100->e@', or '100->200@' and pressing enter shows text within these line ranges.
- Surrounding Lines: Typing '^10@phrase1', '>10r@pattern', or '<10@phrase2' and pressing enter shows lines around the specified phrase or pattern.

Note: Some commands and phrases can be combined. Use common sense to figure out these combinations.
